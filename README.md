# tidal_purple_plum
Purple theme for TidaLuna
Contains a bunch of fixes for visual glitches in the default Tidal theme. Just change the variables in root:: to give it whatever colors you'd like. Custom decorations are in two sections, remove by deleting the "Artist name" section and "decorative circle" respectively.
Based on TidalCustomTheme by Carlos Miranda, highly modified.
